https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/intro-to-vue-js/

Intro to Vue.js is a great course to introduce you to the wonderful world of Vue.js! The instructors are funny, objective, and really know their stuff!

As I progress through the course, I will be adding the files for each of the lessons.


09 - Communicating Events

10 - Forms

In this lesson weâ€™ll be learning how to work with forms in Vue in order to collect user input, and also learn how to do some custom form validation.
