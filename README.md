# Vue-Mastery

https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/intro-to-vue-js/

Intro to Vue.js is a great course to introduce you to the wonderful world of Vue.js! The instructors are funny, objective, and really know their stuff!

As I progress through the course, I will be adding the files for each of the lessons.


09 - Communicating Events

In our previous lesson, we learned how to create components and pass data down into them via props. But what about when we need to pass information back up? In this lesson we’ll learn how to communicate from a child component up to its parent.

10 - Forms

In this lesson we’ll be learning how to work with forms in Vue in order to collect user input, and also learn how to do some custom form validation.
